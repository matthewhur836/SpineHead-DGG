# Actin Dynamical Graph Grammar (DGG) Model of the Synaptic Spine Head
The code in this repository simulates membrane growth from an interaction between membrane and an internal actin cytoskeletal network for a synaptic spine head.

INSTRUCTIONS: For a way to run a simulation, download Wolfram Engine and run the .wls script in the repository. Each run will save a single synaptic spine head simulation in the home repository, as well as a folder containing frames for visualization at the end of mutliple hours of simulation (https://www.wolfram.com/engine/index.php.en).

Otherwise, you can run and interact with the notebook itself using a version of Mathematica.

You will also need to install Plenum, the DGG package, in the right directory of your Wolfram installation: https://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/theses/guy/Plenum.html

As an example, a video of individual simulations are shown: circles being coarse-grained actin objects, color indicating angular energy with green being the barbed end, triangles being capped-ends, and hexagons being CaMKII bundling objects.
